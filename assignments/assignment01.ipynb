    "This was an interesting exploration. There are many VERY LARGE datasets of different famous sports online:\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Soccer StatsBomb Open Data [Link](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)\n",

    "If you want the \"biggest\" dataset in all of sports analytics by raw number of observations, this is it. It's arguably the largest publicly available structured dataset for any game in existence. As of now, it contains over ***7 BILLION*** games of chess played. It provides wins/losses and includes every move made in every game, player Elo ratings, time control, and move-by-move timestamps.\n",
