    "$$\\mu_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_0, \\tau)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mu_0 = 100$ is the league-average skill level (centering parameter)\n",
    "- $\\tau = 15$ is the standard deviation of skill across teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Interpretation\n",
    "- **$\\mu_0 = 100$**: This represents the average skill level in the league. We use 100 as a convenient baseline (similar to IQ scaling).\n",
    "- **$\\tau = 15$**: This captures how spread out team skills are. With $\\tau = 15$, about 68% of teams have skills between 85 and 115, and about 95% between 70 and 130.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Distribution is Plausible\n",
    "A Normal distribution for team skills is plausible because:\n",
    "1. **Central Limit Theorem**: Team strength aggregates many factors (player talent, coaching, resources, chemistry), and the sum of many independent factors tends toward normality.\n",
    "2. **Empirical Evidence**: In most sports leagues, there's a \"middle of the pack\" with a few exceptional and a few poor teams - consistent with a bell curve.\n",
    "3. **Continuous Skill**: Unlike discrete categories, team skill exists on a continuum, which normal distributions model well.\n",
    "4. **Symmetric Spread**: It's reasonable to assume teams are equally likely to be above or below average."

    "\n",
    "1. **Skill-based seeding (`seeding='skill'`)**: Teams are sorted by their mean skill μ in descending order. The highest-ranked team (seed 1) plays the lowest-ranked team (seed 64), seed 2 plays seed 63, and so on. This is similar to how real tournaments like March Madness work, where the bracket is designed so that the best teams don't meet until later rounds.\n",

    "### Analysis: The Role of Seeding in Single-Elimination Tournaments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Skill-based seeding HELPS top teams**: Under skill-based seeding, the best teams have a higher probability of winning the tournament. This is because they face weaker opponents in early rounds, saving their toughest matchups for later when fewer games need to be won.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random seeding creates more parity**: With random seeding, the best teams can be knocked out early by facing each other. This reduces their championship probability and spreads wins across more teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Championship probability is more concentrated with seeding**: The scatter plot shows that top teams (blue points) are above the diagonal, meaning they have higher championship probability under skill-based seeding. Lower-ranked teams (red points) are below the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seeding protects favorites but doesn't guarantee success**: Even with favorable seeding, the best team typically wins less than 20-30% of tournaments due to game-to-game variability. Single-elimination tournaments inherently have high variance because one bad game ends your run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does seeding matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a single-elimination tournament, you must win 6 consecutive games to be champion\n",
    "- With seeding, the #1 seed's expected opponent quality starts low and gradually increases\n",
    "- Without seeding, the #1 seed might face the #2 seed in Round 1, with the winner exhausting luck early\n",
    "- Seeding ensures that if the best teams both play to their ability, they meet in the final (maximizing drama and \"deserved\" outcomes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for real sports:**\n",
    "This explains why leagues use seeding based on regular season performance (like March Madness or NFL playoffs). It rewards regular-season success and makes it more likely that the \"best\" team wins, though upsets remain possible due to single-game variance."

    "## (b) Alternative Competition Structure: Swiss System Tournament\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Swiss System** is a non-eliminating tournament format that provides a middle ground between round-robin (everyone plays everyone) and single-elimination (one loss and you're out). The key rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed number of rounds**: The tournament runs for a predetermined number of rounds (typically $\\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil$ to $\\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil + 2$ rounds for $N$ participants).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No elimination**: All players/teams continue to play in every round, regardless of previous results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pairing by score**: In each round after the first, players are paired with opponents who have the same (or similar) cumulative score. Winners play winners, losers play losers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No repeat matchups**: A player cannot face the same opponent twice during the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final ranking**: At the end, players are ranked by their total points (wins). Tiebreakers often include head-to-head results, strength of schedule, or Buchholz score (sum of opponents' scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example: FIDE Chess Tournaments\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Chess Olympiad** is one of the largest team chess events, where 180+ national teams compete over 11 rounds using the Swiss System. This format allows a massive field to determine rankings without requiring the thousands of games a full round-robin would need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source**: FIDE Handbook, Section C.04 - Swiss System Rules  \n",
    "https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/C0403\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is **Magic: The Gathering Grand Prix/MagicFests**, where hundreds of players compete in Swiss rounds before a single-elimination Top 8 playoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis: Best and Worst Skill Distributions for Swiss System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best suited for:**\n",
    "- **Large field with dispersed skills**: When you have many participants (100+) with a wide range of skill levels, Swiss efficiently separates the top performers without requiring $O(N^2)$ games like round-robin.\n",
    "- **Moderate variance ($\\sigma$)**: With moderate game-to-game variability, the Swiss system's multiple rounds help the cream rise to the top while allowing recovery from a single bad game.\n",
    "- **Clear skill tiers**: When teams cluster into distinct skill tiers, Swiss quickly sorts them as similar-record teams play each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst suited for:**\n",
    "- **Very similar $\\mu$ values (compressed skill distribution)**: When many teams have nearly identical skill, the Swiss system struggles because early-round pairings are essentially random among equals, and outcomes depend heavily on who you happen to face. More rounds are needed to differentiate, but you can't repeat opponents.\n",
    "- **Very high variance ($\\sigma$)**: With large game-to-game variability, even the best team might lose several games to weaker opponents by chance. Since there's no elimination, a high-$\\sigma$ favorite might accumulate losses and end up with mediocre standings despite high $\\mu$.\n",
    "- **Small number of participants**: With few teams (< 16), round-robin becomes feasible and provides more complete information about relative skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: The Swiss system trades off information completeness for efficiency. It generates $N \\times R$ games (where $R$ is rounds) compared to $N(N-1)/2$ for round-robin, but provides less certainty about true rankings. This tradeoff is favorable when $N$ is large and skill differences are substantial enough to emerge in limited rounds."
